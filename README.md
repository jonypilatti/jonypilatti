  <h1>	🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌Hello there! 🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌</h1>
<h3>My name is Jonathan Pilatti 👋 and I'm a 26 years old Argentinian Full Stack Web Developer ❤️‍🔥.</h3>
<div>Ever since I was a child I wanted to program videogames but at some point in life I ended up doing Civil Engineering🤔. During the pandemic, I had plenty of time available to wonder if that was really what I wanted to do with my life. Turns out it wasn't	😅. On January 2022, I entered HENRY for the full stack developer course. It was at that moment that I knew that was what I wanted to do with my life 😄. After giving my all I graduated from HENRY🤯.

	<div>On this Github you will find a collection of practices I completed(or not) since I started programming. Hope you enjoy it!😉</div>

<p>Here you will find content that gives you veridical proof of my knowledge about the following technologies: </p>

	<li> <p>😜Facts about me: I'm usually very easy to get along with because I always know what(or when) to say in a normal conversation. That's the reason why I also get along with many different kinds of people despite all of them having nothing in common. I love sports and have been practicing martial arts since I was 15. Nowadays I only lift weights in the gym.
